# Sana / Sana Sprint – Research Experiments

This repo is a **research playground** for experiments on top of `SANA` and `Sana Sprint` diffusion models.  
It currently includes **prototype code**, **one-off experiments**, and **work-in-progress training scripts** (LoRA, DreamBooth-style tuning, zoom conditioning, etc.).

> ⚠️ Expect breaking changes, messy APIs, and incomplete features — this is **not** a polished library (yet).
